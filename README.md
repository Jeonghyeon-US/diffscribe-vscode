- **Mobile-Friendly**: Review code changes on your phone via any AI chat app
- **Smart Context Management**: Perfect with Repomix ‚Äì provide initial codebase context, then use hunks mode for efficient incremental AI reviews
- **AI-Optimized Markdown**: Git diff format designed for maximum LLM comprehension
